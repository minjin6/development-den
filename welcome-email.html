Welcome to Fuse, %{user_name}

You will soon find what you want to know, when you want to know it. Fuse is an exciting communication, learning and collaboration platform that lets you create, share and access knowledge.
You can access Fuse at %{company_url}.

Username: %{user_email}
Password: %{user_password} (default)

Once you’re logged in you can change your password by clicking ‘settings’ in the top right hand corner of the page.

Here is a quick 3 step guide to get you started:

1. Engage: Join communities, participate in discussions, explore useful videos and resources and share valuable content with colleagues. You no longer have to brainstorm in e-mail chains!
2. Communicate: Contribute your own knowledge and ideas using the upload and record buttons. Give others the benefit of your experience and get recognition for your contributions.
3. Learn: Search for what you want to know and find the answer in an engaging format whenever you need it or work through a topic to evolve your understanding of a particular area.

I hope you enjoy the platform!

Please don't hesitate to contact %{support_email} should you run into any difficulties.

Thanks,
Ed
